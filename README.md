I've been building websites, web apps, and intuitive UIs for **4+ years** — and along the way, I’ve explored everything from **React and Tailwind**, to **Spring Boot APIs**, to **AWS deployments** and **Power BI dashboards**.

I’ve worked with international clients like **FIFA**, helped ship SaaS products, and currently support campus-wide tech events at Stevens.
